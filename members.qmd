### University of Glasgow

The Statistics and Data analytics group at Glasgow has longstanding expertise in the development and application of Statistical and Data Analytics methodology in both Ecology and Environmental Sciences. About 20 members of permanent staff are undertaking research focussing directly on a large variety of different environmental and ecological applications, including the modelling of biodiversity, species distributions modelling, species conservation, air and water quality monitoring, pollution modelling and the effect of pollution on disease risk, wind speed modelling, land slide prediction and many more. The group also has a strong track-record of  working with spatial- and spatio-temporal data, and combining data from different sources through data and model fusion. This includes, for instance, data collected through sensor networks, satellites and citizen science initiatives.
