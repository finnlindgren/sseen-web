    "section": "",
    "text": "The Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews have substantial complementary expertise across environmental and ecological statistics, both within Statistics groups and throughout other academic disciplines across each campus. Additionally, each group has strong relationships with a number of external (to the HEI) partners across a variety of application domains. All groups have a strong focus and interest in developing methodology leading to longer-term impact across policy, business and industry.\nThe Scottish Statistical Environmental and Ecological informal network has been formed to bring together these groups to share expertise, form new collaborations, and link with external partners across industry and policy makers."
