title: "Scottish Statistical Environmental and Ecological Network (SSEEN)"
---

The Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews have substantial
complementary expertise across environmental and ecological statistics, both within
Statistics groups and throughout other academic disciplines across each campus.
Additionally, each group has strong relationships with a number of external (to the
HEI) partners across a variety of application domains. All groups have a strong
focus and interest in developing methodology leading to longer-term impact across
policy, business and industry.

The Scottish Statistical Environmental and Ecological informal network has been
formed to bring together these groups to share expertise, form new collaborations,
and link with external partners across industry and policy makers.
